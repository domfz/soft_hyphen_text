# SoftHyphenText

This widget can be used like the text widget but takes care of soft hyphens inside strings and wraps the text accordingly.



## Features

- Handles soft hyphens (U+00AD) in text
- Automatically adds visible hyphens when text wraps at a soft hyphen position
- Preserves original text when no wrapping occurs

## Getting started

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  soft_hyphen_text: ^0.0.1
```

## Usage

Simply use the `SoftHyphenText` widget instead of the standard `Text` widget:

```dart
SoftHyphenText(text: 'HelloÂ­world')
```

The soft hyphen character (U+00AD) is invisible but indicates potential hyphenation points. When the text wraps at these points, a visible hyphen will be displayed.

### Example with different container widths

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Container(
      width: 80,
      child: SoftHyphenText(text: 'TextWithSoftHyphenCharacter'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Additional information

- All standard `Text` widget properties like `style`, `textAlign`, etc. are supported.
